## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or higher
- macOS 12.0 or higher
- 8GB RAM minimum (16GB recommended)
- Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) or Intel x86_64

## Install from PyPI

```bash
pip install apple-bci-hid-compression
```

## Install from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apple-bci-hid-compression/apple-bci-hid-compression.git
cd apple-bci-hid-compression
pip install -e .
```

## Verify Installation

```python
import apple_bci_hid_compression as bci

# Check version
print(bci.__version__)

# Run basic functionality test
bci.test_installation()

## Basic Usage

```python
from apple_bci_hid_compression import BCICompressionBridge

# Initialize the bridge
bridge = BCICompressionBridge()

# Configure for your device
bridge.configure({
    'compression_ratio': 3.2,

    'fidelity_threshold': 0.94
})

# Start processing
bridge.start()

# Your BCI data will now be compressed and forwarded
# to the HID system automatically
```

## Performance Monitoring

```python
# Get real-time performance metrics
metrics = bridge.get_performance_metrics()
print(f"Latency: {metrics.latency}ms")
print(f"Compression: {metrics.compression_ratio}x")
print(f"Fidelity: {metrics.fidelity:.2%}")

## BCICompressionBridge

The main class for BCI-HID compression functionality.

### Constructor

```python
BCICompressionBridge(config: Optional[Dict] = None)
```

### Methods

#### configure(config: Dict) -> None

Configure the compression bridge with specified parameters.

**Parameters:**
- `config`: Configuration dictionary with compression settings

#### start() -> None

Start the BCI compression bridge processing.

#### stop() -> None

Stop the BCI compression bridge processing.

#### get_performance_metrics() -> PerformanceMetrics

Get current performance metrics.

**Returns:**
- `PerformanceMetrics`: Object containing latency, compression ratio, and fidelity metrics

## Hardware Optimization

### Apple Silicon Optimization

For best performance on Apple Silicon:

```python
bridge.configure({
    'use_neural_engine': True,
    'optimize_for_apple_silicon': True,
    'thread_count': 'auto'
})
```

### Memory Management

```python
# Optimize memory usage
bridge.configure({
    'buffer_size': 1024,  # Adjust based on available RAM
    'memory_pool_size': 256,
    'garbage_collection': 'adaptive'
})
```

## Algorithm Tuning

### Compression vs Latency Trade-off

```python
# Low latency (gaming, real-time control)
bridge.configure({
    'compression_ratio': 2.5,
    'latency_target': 15,
    'algorithm': 'fast'
})

# High compression (bandwidth-limited scenarios)
bridge.configure({
    'compression_ratio': 4.0,
    'latency_target': 50,
    'algorithm': 'efficient'
})
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

```python
# Enable detailed performance logging
bridge.enable_performance_logging(level='debug')

# Monitor real-time performance
for metrics in bridge.stream_metrics():
    if metrics.latency > 30:
        print(f"High latency detected: {metrics.latency}ms")
