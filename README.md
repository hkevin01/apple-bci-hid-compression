# Apple BCI-HID Compression Bridge

A specialized compression and interface layer that enables Apple's BCI HID technology to work more efficiently with existing BCI compression algorithms, focusing on low latency and high signal quality.

## Features

- 🧠 HID-Optimized Neural Compression Pipeline
- 🔗 Apple Device Integration Layer
- ⚡ Real-time Neural-to-HID Translation
- 📱 Cross-Platform Apple Device Support
- 🔒 Privacy-First Design
- 🎯 Apple Silicon Optimization

## Requirements

- macOS 13.0+ / iOS 16.0+ / iPadOS 16.0+
- Xcode 15.0+
- Swift 5.9+
- Python 3.11+
- Apple Silicon Mac (recommended for development)

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/yourusername/apple-bci-hid-compression.git", from: "0.1.0")
]
```

### Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

```swift
import AppleBCICore
import HIDInterface

// Initialize the BCI controller
let controller = BCIHIDController()

// Process neural input
Task {
    let neuralData = NeuralData(/* your data here */)
    let event = await controller.processNeuralInput(neuralData)
    // Handle the HID event
}
```
